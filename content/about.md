## Trusted, accessible, trans-friendly spaces. Always

### The Trans Dimension is an online community hub connecting trans communities across the UK. We collate news, events and services by and for trans people.

We see and experience the barriers in place for trans, non-binary, and gender diverse people trying to meet, connect, and socialise and know that for disabled trans people the challenge is even harder. Our goal is to support and facilitate community connections through safe spaces and networks across the UK.

At its core, The Trans Dimension is a digital partnership built on real-life trust networks. We’re not here to play accessibility cop or judge and jury, we just want to increase access to trans-led and trans-friendly spaces for all of us.

The Trans Dimension is run by Geeks for Social Change in partnership with Gendered Intelligence with support from the Comic Relief Tech for Good programme.

At this stage, the Trans Dimension is focussed on London-based events listings only, however we do plan to expand to cover more areas across the UK.

## Our Accessibility Process

### As a trans and disabled led project, we have worked to put accessibility at the heart of everything we do.

As an event listings site, we know how challenging it can sometimes be to find detailed accessibility information about venues. While some spaces offer in-depth information on their websites about quantity and steepness of stairs, lighting styles used in performances, accessibility of toilets, and anything else you could possibly need to know, so many more offer little to no information at all.

As part of the process of being listed on the Trans Dimension, we insist that venues provide detailed accessibility information, so that you are able to make an informed choice about whether an event will be possible and comfortable for you to attend.

We also know that for many people, trying out new events or groups can sometimes be daunting! We try and make sure that listings go into as much detail as possible about their content and style, so that you know what to expect, and can feel well-informed and excited about attending events and getting to know the trans community in your area!

We have tried to design this website to be as usable as possible. If you think that there is anything we could do to improve the site, please do drop us a message: transdimension@gfsc.studio

## Built Using PlaceCal

### ![Placecal logo](/images/placecallogo.svg) PlaceCal

PlaceCal is a package of software and training developed by Geeks for Social Change.

It is a community directory and events calendar where you can find out everything that's happening in your neighbourhood, all in one place.

The goal of the project was to combat causes of social isolation and loneliness in neighbourhoods across the UK. PlaceCal's technology is what runs The Trans Dimension.

To find out more about PlaceCal, including how to get involved with setting one up in your neighbourhood, visit [placecal.org](https://placecal.org).
