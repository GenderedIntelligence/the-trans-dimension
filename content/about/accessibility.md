As an event listings site, we know how challenging it can sometimes be to find detailed accessibility information about venues. While some spaces offer in-depth information on their websites about quantity and steepness of stairs, lighting styles used in performances, accessibility of toilets, and anything else you could possibly need to know, so many more offer little to no information at all.

As part of the process of being listed on the Trans Dimension, we insist that venues provide detailed accessibility information, so that you are able to make an informed choice about whether an event will be possible and comfortable for you to attend.

We also know that for many people, trying out new events or groups can sometimes be daunting! We try and make sure that listings go into as much detail as possible about their content and style, so that you know what to expect, and can feel well-informed and excited about attending events and getting to know the trans community in your area!

We have tried to design this website to be as usable as possible. We aim to conform to [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref) to level AA.

If you think that there is anything we could do to improve the site, please do [drop us a message](mailto:info@transdimension.uk).
