title: "About"
subtitle: "The Trans Dimension is an online community hub connecting trans communities across the UK. We collate news, events and services by and for trans people."

We see and experience the barriers in place for trans, non-binary, and gender diverse people trying to meet, connect, and socialise and know that for disabled trans people the challenge is even harder. Our goal is to support and facilitate community connections through safe spaces and networks across the UK.

At its core, The Trans Dimension is a digital partnership built on real-life trust networks. Weâ€™re not here to play accessibility cop or judge and jury, we just want to increase access to trans-led and trans-friendly spaces for all of us.

The Trans Dimension is run by Geeks for Social Change in partnership with Gendered Intelligence with support from the Comic Relief Tech for Good programme.

At this stage, the Trans Dimension is focussed on London-based events listings only, however we do plan to expand to cover more areas across the UK.
