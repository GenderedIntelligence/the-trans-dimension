PlaceCal is a package of software and training developed by Geeks for Social Change.

It is a community directory and events calendar where you can find out everything that's happening in your neighbourhood, all in one place.

The goal of the project was to combat causes of social isolation and loneliness in neighbourhoods across the UK. PlaceCal's technology is what runs The Trans Dimension.

To find out more about PlaceCal, including how to get involved with setting one up in your neighbourhood, visit [placecal.org](https://placecal.org).
